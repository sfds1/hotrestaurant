This is an application that allows users to enter in their ID, name, email and phone number to reserve a table at a restaurant.

## What does the app do?
A user is able to do a few functions in this app.  They can enter in information to reserve a table.  If the reservation table has 5 people on it already, then the user will go to the waiting list.  There are alerts that give the user feedback to this effect.
The user can click on links to see the reservation table list or the waitlist table list.  There is also a link to clear all the tables
